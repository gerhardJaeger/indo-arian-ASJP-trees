When animate nouns are modified by a numeral, the form of the numeral used is different from that which is used when an inanimate noun is modified by a numeral \citep[60]{Chandralal2010}. Plural marking is obligatory, when applicable.

diml1238
According to \citet[19ff.]{Paul1998}, a morphologically singular noun can be used in a generic sense, but nouns denoting a plurality, definite or indefinite, take the plural ending. Plural marking is non-obligatory. An apparent sortal classifier {\it teney} co-occurs with nouns marked both for singular and plural.

Bagri
bagr1243
There are at least three declensional classes, in one of which the plural and singular direct forms are identical. The distinction between animacy and inanimacy, rather than ending in {\it -i} versus other segments, is made by the author, who explicitly states that the suffix {\it -\~{a}} is optional on animate nouns. This is almost akin to a mixture of a system like that of Hindi, where plural cannot be marked on some noun case forms, and a system where plural marking is truly optional.

Modern Persian has several numeral classifiers, the most basic and widespread of which is {\it t\=a}, optionally used with numbers larger than one \citep[478]{WindfuhrPerry2009}.

\citet[66--7]{Cardona1965} refers to the plural marker {\it -o} as ``optional,'' and it seems to largely be omitted when nouns are modified by a number greater than 1; so-called ``variable'' nouns display a special ``dependent stem form'' when they are semantically plural, regardless of the presence of the suffix {\it -o}.

Kalam Kohistani achieves plural marking on a number of nouns via a vowel fronting process, which also is found in oblique forms of nouns, and appears to mark plural consistently on nouns \citep[21]{BaartSagar2004}.

From \citeapos{Thomas1930} description, plural marking appears to be obligatory. Kumzari numerals are nearly identical to their Modern Persian cognates; however, from seven upwards, the Kumzari numerals all end in {\it -t\=a}, which is analyzed as a suffix. For human beings, a suffix {\it -kay} attaches to the number one {\it yek(kay)}; for two onward, the suffix {\it -kas} is used. According to a newer description, the numeral classifier {\it -t\=a} or {\it -ta} in Kumzari can also occur on numerals below seven \citep[47]{WalAnonby2015}

According to \citet[21--2]{Xromov1972}, when numbers two and upward combine with nouns, the noun is found in the oblique singular form; if measure terms are used, the measure term is marked for oblique singular.

Plural number must be marked on semantically plural nouns, except where morphologically impossible, e.g., masculine kinship terms, certain loanwords \citep[366--7]{Pandharipande1997}. \citet[11]{Emeneau1956} claims that Marathi has a classifier {\it ja\d{n}/ja\d{n}\d{\={\i}}} (f.) that appears``when nouns denoting persons are numerated by numerals higher than four (and optionally for two to four).'' \citet[243]{Lambert1943} says the following: ``When the numerals refer to persons, special forms are used instead of don, tin, car; to other numerals the word {\IPA z@\:n} (m. {\IPA z@\:n}, cf.fem. {\IPA z@\:na(n)}; f. {\IPA z@\:ni}, cr.fem. {\IPA z@\:ni(n)}) is usually added. This word is often added also to the special forms of {\it don}, {\it tin}, {\it car}.'' No examples are given. \citet[50]{Katenina1963} gives examples of the special forms {\it doghe}, {\it tighe}, {\it \'caughe}, as well as the forms {\it {\'\j}a\d{n}} (m.) and {\it {\'\j}a\d{n}\={\i}} (f.) `people' which show the latter form as a head noun, but never in close apposition with another (head) noun. The interaction between the numerals and {\it {\'\j}a\d{n}(\={\i})} is striking; however, other grammars gloss these special forms simply as `both', `the three', and `the four' respectively \citep[59]{DhongdeWali2009}. These forms appear in Old Marathi as substantivized numerals, e.g., {\it he tighe bh\=au} `these three were brothers' (\citealt{Tulpule1963}, apud \citealt[425]{Southworth1970}).

Singular forms are always morphologically distinct from their plural counterparts, usually via the addition of a plural suffix or alternation of the final vowel \citep[23ff.]{Igla1996}. When a numeral greater than one modifies a noun, the noun is morphologically plural (p.\ 45). When the counted item consists of indefinite objects, then {\it -tane} ($<$ Turkish {\it tane} `piece, part') appears next to the numeral; anaphoric use of this classifier is obligatory (p.\ 45).

Plural number is marked on nouns by means of the suffix {\it -t-} \citep[117]{Thordarson2009}. In most contexts (except for contexts of enumeration, see below), use of {\it -t-} appears to be obligatory. When a noun is enumerated by a numeral greater than one, the noun is marked by the suffix -i (Digor), identical to the genitive suffix. According to \citet[132]{Thordarson2009}, this suffix continues the Old Iranian plural suffix {\it *-ah}. Nouns enumerated by numbers greater than one are always marked in a way that renders them distinct from singular nouns.

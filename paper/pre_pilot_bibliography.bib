@article{Parpola2002,
	Annote = {Here, Parpola posits several waves of migration from the BMAC into Central and South Asia, in chronological order: (1) Pre-Proto-Iranian D\={a}sas, (2) ``Atharvavedic'' Proto-Indo-Aryans, (3) \textsubring{R}gvedic Proto-Indo-Aryans, and (4) Proto-Iranians. P argues that the D\={a}sas were the ancestors of the Sakas, Nuristanis, and Magadhans. Much of P's argument is non-linguistic. P's linguistic rationale for linking Sakas, Nuristanis, and Magadhans (and to some degree speakers of Atharvavedic) is the preservation of PIE *l, though Magadhi has \textit{l} for PIE *r as well. P explains Magadhi \textit{\'{s}} from Old Indic (or really, Proto-Indic) *s by Dravidian substratum interference, surmising that Proto-Dravidian influence would cause a change *s $>$ *\'s because the only sibilant-like phoneme in the PD inventory was the palatal affricate *c, realized intervocalically as a sibilant. An early arrival of Magadhans in the Indus valley and Gangetic Plain would explain why Magadhi was the easternmost Prakrit.

This article is admittedly ``speculative'' in a number of ways, but even with this admission, a number of quasi-facts are eagerly presupposed by P. For instance, he gives statements like ``The Toda tribe of the Nilagiris, for example, \textsc{seems} to descend from Saka horsemen who around 400 AD married local Dravidian-speaking women, and the Pallava dynasty of the Tamils \textsc{may} have been founded by Pahlava warriors'' (p. 247-8, emphasis mine). While they are not crucial to his argument, their inclusion is slightly troubling since there is virtually no evidence for either claim being the case (and none is cited). It seems crucial to me to be able to tease apart actual fact from folk-historical tradition; cf. Morgenstierne (\textit{Indo-Iranian Frontier Languages, v. 1}, p. 311): ``I do not think the traditions about the Arab or Kurdish descent of the Ormurs quoted above are much more valuable than those which make the Pathans Israelites, the Baloches Syrians, the \"Ozbin Pashais Quraishis from Mekka, the Chitralis descendants of Alexander's deported prisoners...or the Gurkhas and Burmese Hazaras [a `tradition' M claims in a footnote that his Pashtun servant `dreamed up on the spot'].''},

B appeals to the ``principle of density'' to explain dialectal differentiation, hypothesizing that a speakers adapt the speech-habits of their interlocutors, either giving up old forms, adopting new ones, or changing the frequency of forms without abandoning old ones or adopting ``really'' new ones. B suggests that the spread of an innovation is limited when it comes up against weaknesses in the network of oral communication, which can be caused by topographical or social boundaries.

B associates various European isoglosses with extralinguistic sociopolitical or religious boundaries.

The authors focus also on socially and areally disseminated or diffused sound changes and present a number of interesting case studies, such as the spread of uvular [R] through northern Europe. A third, more novel subfield is also mentioned---so called "human geography", which develops dynamic models of diffusion with social indexicality and population networks as independent variables.},

Gershevitch begins with a discussion of words in Middle and New Persian showing variation between \textit{\v{s}} and \textit{h} for PIr *\'{s}y, e.g., NP \textit{mih} `greater' : Av \textit{masiia-}; NP \textit{be\v{s}} `more' $<$ *wa\'sya-.

He argues against attempts to regularly account for the phonological distribution of these reflexes, and states that Old Persian must have had dialectal variation in its reflexes of PIE *\'k, *\'g, *\'ky and *\s\'k. He maintains however that \textit{sp} for PIr *\'sw in OP is likely of ``Median provenance.''},

Here, he argues that some instances of retroflexion in Indic, Dravidian, and East Iranian are due to interference from (yet?) another substratum. A staring presupposition of the paper is that retroflexion caused by Proto-Indic *\d{z} (as well as Fortunatov's Law) is an independent Indic development not caused by a substrate (cf. Norwegian and Swedish retroflexion). He focuses instead on sporadic late Vedic retroflexion of dentals after \textit{r}, e.g., \textit{vik\textsubring{r}ta-} $\mathtt{\sim}$ \textit{vika\d{t}a} `deformed'. He believes that \textit{vika\d{t}a} etc. represent original alveolars, and wishes to set up a dental : alveolar : retroflex contrast in early Indic, E Iranian, and Dravidian. At some point, the alveolar series would merge with either the dental or retroflex series (this seems to be the case in different late RV dialects, given \textit{kitava-} `gambler' vs. \textit{vika\d{t}a}) in Indic, E Iranian, and all of Dravidian except for Malayalam and Tamil. He admits that this view is highly speculative.},

The former phenomenon is shown to lose many of its original conditioning factors as it diffuses from New York to neighboring cities. Additionally, the Northern Cities shift is shown to be incompletely implemented among St. Louisans with a great deal of overlap between categories, pointing to the borrowing of individual sound changes rather than the entire pattern---this is interesting, since in L 1981, the NCS exemplified a low-level output rule defined by fairly regular sound change.

	Annote = {This paper presents five archeological models and their relation to historical linguistics: (1) the continuity model, the premise of which is that if there has been no major lacuna in the archeological record, there has been linguistic continuity (this model is employed in the Indigenous Aryans Theory); (2) the discontinuity model, which argues that where there are apparent breaks in an archeological record, there has been linguistic intrusion; (3) the geographical model, where locations are sought in correlation with a language's distribution; (4) the cultural model, where material culture is associated with a particular language; and (5) the contact model, where language spread is thought to be due to language shift. Indo-Iranian archaeological records are geographically and chronologically disparate. The four zones corresponding to Indo-Iranian migration are sequenced as follows: the Dnieper-Ural region serves as the staging ground for the development of Proto-Indo-Iranian; the language moves to the Ural-Yenisei region, and then to the Bactria-Margiana Archeological Complex, finally dispersing into Iran and India. M introduces the ``Kulturkugel'' model, which proposes that it is possible for a group to maintain its social organization and language but adopt a new material culture, which describes the linguistic, social and cultural situation of the early Indo-Iranians following their passage through BMAC.},

N seems to suggest an increase in features analyzed, but analyzed at more abstract levels (rather than a small number of features observed at an incredibly low level of detail). (N notes that traditional dialectology already implicitly takes a number of steps which aggregate data, simply in terms of simplifying features.) The gradient geolinguistic properties that emerge when a number of features are observed is demonstrated via a number of dialect maps.

N outlines a methodology for determining distances between two phonetic realizations of a word by aligning the text grids of two narrowly-transcribed words and seeing which segments differ (or are present in one and absent in another); indices of difference measured in this way can be plotted on a map and assigned a hue according to a multi-dimensional scaling analysis.

At the end of the paper, N concedes that ``aggregation'' is a very general term, and the paper has not dwelt at all on what types of linguistic features can be aggregated in the most meaningful manner (according to context).},

In some cases, Armenian inflects Iranian loans as \textit{-o}-stems, but there are no \textit{-o}-stems in Iranian. The author suggests that the somewhat random correspondence between Iranian \textit{-a}-stems and Armenian \textit{-a}, \textit{-o} and \textit{-u}-stems has to do with the dialectal diversity of Iranian sources. Parthian and Middle Persian are generally the most identifiable source languages of Iranian loans in Armenian, but O suggests that loanwords from East Iranian languages may be present in Armenian as well, invoking the ``Parnian'' East Iranian element in Parthian.},

	Annote = {Here, Parpola posits several waves of migration from the BMAC into Central and South Asia, in chronological order: (1) Pre-Proto-Iranian D\={a}sas, (2) ``Atharvavedic'' Proto-Indo-Aryans, (3) \textsubring{R}gvedic Proto-Indo-Aryans, and (4) Proto-Iranians. P argues that the D\={a}sas were the ancestors of the Sakas, Nuristanis, and Magadhans. Much of P's argument is non-linguistic. P's linguistic rationale for linking Sakas, Nuristanis, and Magadhans (and to some degree speakers of Atharvavedic) is the preservation of PIE *l, though Magadhi has \textit{l} for PIE *r as well. P explains Magadhi \textit{\'{s}} from Old Indic (or really, Proto-Indic) *s by Dravidian substratum interference, surmising that Proto-Dravidian influence would cause a change *s $>$ *\'s because the only sibilant-like phoneme in the PD inventory was the palatal affricate *c, realized intervocalically as a sibilant. An early arrival of Magadhans in the Indus valley and Gangetic Plain would explain why Magadhi was the easternmost Prakrit.

This article is admittedly ``speculative'' in a number of ways, but even with this admission, a number of quasi-facts are eagerly presupposed by P. For instance, he gives statements like ``The Toda tribe of the Nilagiris, for example, \textsc{seems} to descend from Saka horsemen who around 400 AD married local Dravidian-speaking women, and the Pallava dynasty of the Tamils \textsc{may} have been founded by Pahlava warriors'' (p. 247-8, emphasis mine). While they are not crucial to his argument, their inclusion is slightly troubling since there is virtually no evidence for either claim being the case (and none is cited). It seems crucial to me to be able to tease apart actual fact from folk-historical tradition; cf. Morgenstierne (\textit{Indo-Iranian Frontier Languages, v. 1}, p. 311): ``I do not think the traditions about the Arab or Kurdish descent of the Ormurs quoted above are much more valuable than those which make the Pathans Israelites, the Baloches Syrians, the \"Ozbin Pashais Quraishis from Mekka, the Chitralis descendants of Alexander's deported prisoners...or the Gurkhas and Burmese Hazaras [a `tradition' M claims in a footnote that his Pashtun servant `dreamed up on the spot'].''},

	Annote = {This paper relies primarily on archeological and cultural evidence for the argument that the people referred to as D\={a}sa/Daha/Dahae etc. were the ancestors of Sakas/Scythians.

P proposes a linguistic argument that ``Proto-Avestan'' was ``Proto-Saka,'' based on the fact that the word for `god' in Avestan, Khotanese Saka, and pre-Christian Ossetic comes from *yazata-, as against *baga- in the rest of Iranian. In the Gathas, \textit{yazata-} occurs only once. Young Avestan has both terms, according to Parpola, and ``\textit{ba{\textgamma}a-} occurs...much less frequently than \textit{-yajata-} [\textit{sic}?]'' (p. 247).\\

From a linguistic standpoint, I am definitely concerned about conflating the terms Scythian and Saka, because the linguistic specimens pertaining to each ethnonym show some differences. (Unfortunately, their main difference is in corpus size, which makes comparison difficult.) I have no doubt that Indo-Iranian Saka/{\'S}aka and Greek Skythas refer to the same loose, heterogeneous group of people. However, Scythian specimens from Tanais give the name {\greektext Baioraspos}, showing \textit{sp} for PIr *\'{s}w. This could very well be a loan, but it is the only reflex of PIr *\'{s}w found in ``Scythian''; there is no positive evidence of a reflex \textit{\v{s}} as seen in Khotanese Saka (\textit{\'s\'s} and Wakhi, which, with its palatal quality, is often taken as a very archaic trait of Saka. Ossetic, on the other hand, almost always shows \textit{fs}, reflecting earlier *sp.},

Ormuri and Parachi are linked to Balochi, Bashkardi, and the old language of Zabulistan through the development *w $>$ \textit{gw} (\textit{{\textgamma}w}). S mentions that Ormuri contains a number of old Pashto loans (preceding certain Pashto sound changes, such as *-aka- $>$ \textit{-ay}).},

	Annote = {Argues for corpus-based dialectometry over single-feature atlas-based dialectology. The advantages of using a corpus is that observations can be frequency-based rather than hinging on an oversimplified, reduced data. The categorical, discrete nature of isoglosses is an oversimplification found in atlases as well. S's methodological sketch involves counting the frequencies of various morphosyntactic features found in a natural speech corpus of English. He then calculates Euclidean distances between the frequencies of features in different dialects; the distribution of these distances can be compared with the distribution of geographic distances between each dialect. S points out some interesting dissimilarities between relatively closely-situated English dialects in Great Britain. S then converts his measures of similarity and distance into a continuum map; using multi-dimensional scaling, he is able to assign a number of polygons representing dialects a hue according to its position in three-dimensional space. The hues of continuous polygons are not often gradient, signifying that geographic continuity and dialectal continuity do not always go hand in hand. Finally, S uses a clustering algorithm which initially constructs a dendrogram based on cophenetic distances between different data points.

S stresses the fact that this is a methodological sketch that has not paid much attention to the broader linguistic implications of the dialect differences measured. He mentions also that this sort of analysis is not limited to morphosyntactic phenomena, but that ``phonology, lexis and even pragmatics are all in principle amenable to dialectometrical analysis using a corpus-based approach.''

A benefit of the dialect atlas is that it is often interpretable from a standpoint of diachronic linguistics; isoglosses often correspond to diachronic developments. This sort of dialect study seems to potentially deviate from that sort of diachronic applicability. And I wonder about the clarity of the linguistic signal based on aggregate morphosyntactic data. Focusing on different frequencies/rates of one particular morphosyntactic feature (controlling, of course, for individual variation, etc.) across different dialects could be potentially sociolinguistically informative. However, it is not necessarily clear how to interpret aggregate, corpus-based data.},

Measures aggregate morphosyntactic Euclidean distance against various measures of geographic distance, and fails to find a linear relationship, and finds very little of the variance explained. Using Trudgill's gravity model, which combines geographic data with population statistics, about 24% of the variance is explained. S finds a significant correlation between aggregate morphosyntactic distance and cophenetic distance (Ward's method)---a clustering algorithm used by S to join his dialectal data points into discrete dialect groups. (If he has measured the Euclidean distances and the cophenetic distances according to the same data, should this be a surprise?)

S's conclusion is that geography on its own is not much of a predictor. He mentions the possibility that morphosyntactic variability -- and especially syntactic variability -- is different from phonological or lexical variability. However, he concludes that the most cogent explanation for his result is that ``compared to frequency-based approaches, atlas-based approaches overrate geography,'' due to their categorical nature.},
